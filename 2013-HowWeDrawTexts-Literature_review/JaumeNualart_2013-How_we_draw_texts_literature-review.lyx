 We presented several relevant data and visualization tools in the XXXth
 Ars Electronica exhibition (

The research starts with an inspiring tour through the history and trends
 of text visualization tools according to the aims listed in the next subsection
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Early-research-question:"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on previous practical work, the proposed methodology is based on the
 following three principles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Work on practical problems, involving challenges to be confronted in real
 scenarios.
 Focusing on solving or improving specific tasks clarifies the path to the
 solution.
 Therefore there are possible collaborations with two research groups: the
 Machine Learning Research Group, from NICTA and specially with Principal
 Researcher Wray Buntine (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "nicta_nicta_2013"

\end_inset

); and the Lens.org project (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "cambia.org_lens_2013"

\end_inset

), a group that works with large amounts of texts from patents.
 Nowadays patent texts is an active field of research (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "yang_text_2008"

\end_inset

).
 The text of patents is at once structured and unstructured.
 Structured because it follows quite a strict format, including: title,
 abstract, claims/subclaims tree, very detailed figures, inventors, applicants,
 patent owner, and one or more classifications codes.
 Unstructured because the texts are heavy legal texts with very long sentences
 in which it can be difficult to find dependencies and self references (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Sheremetyeva:2003:NLA:1119303.1119311"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Design visualization tools as a top-down task.
 Top-down approach starts with the big picture.
 It breaks down from there into smaller segments (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "wikipedia_Top-down_and_bottom-up_design_2013"

\end_inset

).
 This methodology advocates for a top-down design starting where the problem
 has been detected: the human level.
 Since there are many technical options for how to develop a piece of software,
 there is no need to care about it from the very beginning.
 The choice of a computer language or a software at the first stage can
 limit the freedom of creativity and, consequently, the result of the research
 project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One task, one visualization.
 But: one dataset, multiple visualizations.
 Since data is the blood of the visualization's body, a good dataset can
 be used for many purposes, so each purpose may require a different visualizatio
n tool in order for each tool to serve the task effectively.
 Of course, one task can have several visualizations that can solve or help
 to solve it, but, in a real case, a specific visualization is finally chosen
 for a specific task.
 An example of this is the web site Manyeyes [
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://www-958.ibm.com"

\end_inset

], that allows anyone to create a visualization from a dataset 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We aim to develop these methodologies in greater depth as the project goes
 on.

Early research question: how can data visualization tools help people working
 with texts?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this early work we are not presenting a concrete question that will drive
 this PhD research.
 Instead this document represents a starting point in the process of developing
 a question and shaping the work of the project The final question will
 form a part of the research proposal, to be presented after this document
 is completed.

Despite that, at this point, it is possible to define what we understand
 by the general afirmation:

\end_inset

.
 Sometimes data visualization is the only way to show evidence.
 The classic example of this was demonstrated in 1973 by the statistician
 Francis Anscombe (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Anscombe's-quartet:-all"

\end_inset

).
 Anscombe's example shows how even simple statistics can be confusing and,
 in some cases, only the visual representation of data can show significant
 features.

The aim of this research is to

 using visualization techniques that can show patterns, behaviors and/or
 evidence of the reality represented by data, improving the way, the speed
 or the clarity with which the facts under the data are shown or discovered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this document we are not trying to include every single text visualization
 tool.
 This would be a never ending project.
 This is why, at this point, we can outline initial areas of focus.
 The points we have considered when analyzing text visualization tools for
 this study are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Individual document representation, in particular ways to extract meaning
 from texts based on writing style, document structure, and language register
 instead of pure statistics.
 We are interested in representing the meaning and salient features of texts
 because a convenient visualization of texts can speed up and/or improve
 our ability to select texts and manage the time to tackle them intellectually.
 The research output of fields like natural language processing, linguistics
 computing, and machine learning offer techniques for producing high quality
 data representing complex texts.
 We propose that combining these techniques with  suitable visualization
 can  improve the way we examine and understand texts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Representation and exploration of collections of texts.
 Ways to explore, and select texts, and navigating and analyzing collections
 of texts is a daily task for a lot of people working with computers and
 data and there is a lot of room for new tools and ideas.
 Information retrieval is a critical factor in an environment characterized
 by excess of information (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "baeza1999modern"

\end_inset

).
 When a user conducts a search, the information retrieval systems normally
 respond with a list of results.
 In many cases, the presentation of those results play an important role
 in satisfying user information needs.
 A bad or inadequate presentation can hinder the satisfaction of information
 needs (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "baeza-yates_new_2011"

\end_inset

).
 Typically, information retrieval systems present the results of a query
 in flat, one dimensional lists.
 Usually, these lists are opaque in terms of order, i.e.
 the users do not know why the list has a particular order.
 To refine their search, the users have to interact again, normally by filtering
 the first output of results.We propose that new techniques for representing
 text collections - including search results - can contribute to improvements
 in navigation, exploration and retrieval.

Therefore data visualization, understood as extraction of data from reality
 and shaped in a two or three-dimensional abstract representation, can be
 considered as part of human culture.

Seven out of top the ten universities, in the Times Higher Education ranking
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Data visualization has developed in a wide range of departments, from computer
 science or statistics to linguistics or graphical design, and from chemistry
 or physics to genetics or history.
 Recently data visualization has emerged as a distinct field, with masters
 programs and departments dedicated to it (see table

\begin_layout Subsection
A multidisciplinary field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data visualization, during its history, has had contributions from multiple
 fields.
 As a natural process, most visualization methods have been created or invented
 out of a necessity to address specific communication needs.
 Looking back to the so-called golden age of visualization (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "chen_handbook_2008"

\end_inset

) it seems that the creations with more impact are the ones with an intention
 of advocacy or a factual claim that, without a visualization tool, would
 not have been easy to demonstrate.
 This is the case of Cholera in London (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "friendly_m_dotmap_2001"

\end_inset

) or Playfair's UK exports (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "friendly_m_linegraph_2001"

\end_inset

) diagram or Minard's time line map (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "friendly_m_flow_2001"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "tufte_e._minards_????"

\end_inset

).
 This necessity, along with creativity, has produced new ideas in a variety
 of fields and knowledge contexts.

 presents a word cloud of the professions of the creators of the most relevant
 visualization methods from 1765 to 1999.

From 1765 to 1999, a list of some of the most important visualization methods
 invented is: Timeline, Bar Chart, Pie chart, Flows in maps, Venn diagram,
 Histogram, Gantt Chart, Flowchart, Tagcloud, Social Networks, Boxplot,
 Star plot, Treemap, Headmap, Tagcloud, Sparkline.
 We present a word cloud of the professions of their inventors (made with
 Wordle).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among others the authors include Joseph Prestley, defined as theologian,
 dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher, chemist, educator, and political
 theorist, who has been credited with the first publication of a time line
 in 1765.
 Also included are the famous visualization gurus William Playfair (pie
 chart, 1801), Charles Joseph Minard (flows in maps, 1869), John Tukey (boxplot,
 1977) and Edward Tufte (sparkline, 1999).
 The structured data and the complete list of authors used to generate this
 word cloud can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Timeline-data-of"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, this multidisciplinary character is applicable even today, where
 most relevant names in the data visualization scene have very different
 backgrounds: from mathematics, statistics or pure computer sciences (Santiago
 Ortiz, Hilary Mason, Amanda Cox, Mike Bostock, Nathan Yau) to graphic design
 (John Maeda, Stefanie Posavec) or journalism (Alberto Cairo, David McCandless)
 and from academics (Ben Shneiderman, Jeff Heer, Andrew Vande Moere, Fernanda
 Viégas, Martin Wattenberg, Chris Harrison, Jeff Clark) to activist (Kim
 Rees, Jake Porway), freelance (Moritz Stefaner, Andy Kirk, Gregor Aisch)
 and corporate (Stephen Few, Robert Kosara, Manuel Lima) worlds.
 In coming years it is likely that new generations will come from the visualizat
ion departments in a growing percentage.

\begin_layout Subsection
The name of the field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several expressions that may refer to what data visualization
 means and there is not universal consent on their exact definitions.
 In scientific publications and books it is easy to find several expressions
 used, sometimes, indistinctly: data visualization, information visualization,
 infographics/information graphics, information design.
 Buzzwords and abbreviations such as datavis, dataviz, and infovis are also
 becoming popular (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:The-names-of"

\end_inset

 & Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Google-trends-in"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of this are the titles of some books; is it really necessary the
 use of that variety of expressions?

There is controversy over the distinctions between all these expressions
 (

).
 Given that their popularity is changing fast.
 we will probably need a bit more time to see which ones will stay and which
 ones will fall into oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we will be using these expressions ordered in three conceptual
 groups as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Data visualization, information visualization: our preferred expression
 is data visualization.
 We will also use information visualization as a general name for the field
 we work on.
 We also use the word representation as a synonym of visualization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Infographics, information graphics: we consider this expression as a subfield
 of data visualization that, usually, is a static image and is not the output
 of a computer code written specifically for this function.
 Digital infographics are usually created with image editors.
 As Cairo argues, the creation of infographics relies more on storytelling
 and narrative skills than on computer programming skills.
 (

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Information design, interface design, data interfaces: more and more data
 visualization tools are overlapping with digital interfaces.
 The digital interface is the permeable and thin medium that puts humans
 in contact with digital creations.
 The interface designer is the person who defines and innovate in the language,
 shape, accessibility and effectiveness of this layer in order to be used
 in one or more ways when a human interacts with it (ware_information).
 Nowadays, the evolution of digital interfaces and radical proposals is
 an active field (

\begin_layout Subsection
The data types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we refer to data types as the formats that data can have in order to
 be processed for later representation.
 In the visualization process, data can be transformed several times before
 it takes on the desired or required format according to the visualization
 technique used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here again there is no a single classification of kinds of data or data-types.
 We are going to use Shneiderman's classification (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "shneiderman_eyes_1996"

\end_inset

) called Task by data Type Taxonomy (TTT) that divides data types in seven
 groups: 1-, 2-, 3-dimansional, Temporal, Multi-dimensional, Tree and Network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1-dimensional data: textual documents, program source code, alphabetical
 lists, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2-dimensional data: geographic maps, floorplants, newspaper layouts, 2-axes
 diagrams, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
3-dimansional data: real world objects such as molecules, bodies, buildings,
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Temporal data: all kinds of timelines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multi-dimensional data: most relational and statistical databases are convenient
ly manipulated as multi-dimensional in which items with n attributes become
 points in a n-dimensional space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tree data: collections of hierarchical data where each item (except the
 root) links to a parent item.
 For example: genealogical data, file systems trees, genetic data, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Network data: any collection of items and their relationships.
 For example: social relationships, computer networks, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data as textual documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study focuses on visualization tools applied to textual documents.
 According to Shneiderman's classification, regular texts would be considered
 1-dimensional data.
 A text is a sequential data that goes right-to-left or left-to-right and
 line by line, top to bottom.
 However a text can have multiple internal structures, e.g.
 according to morphology it can have paragraphs, sentences and words.
 According to the information structure, a text can be ordered by chapters,
 parts, sections, subsections, etc.
 If the text has a format like HTML, then it can be ordered by body, divs,
 paragraphs, etc.
 In those examples the text has a tree structure as a data type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, text visualization is not widely considered as a subfield of
 data visualization.
 Illinski (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "noah_iliinsky_choosing_2013"

\end_inset

) asserts that text cannot be considered as a data type.
 Silić (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) says that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unstructured text is not suitable for visualization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In fact, as mentioned above, most text visualizations transform the initial
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unstructured
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 textual data into a new structured and reduced dataset.
 This new dataset is no longer a 1-dimension data type, but a categorical
 or a network dataset.
 And it can be represented with a wide range of tools not specific to natural
 text representation (

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we will show in chapter 2, most visualizations of texts do not represent
 raw data, that is the text as it is, instead they transform the text into
 smaller chunks of data, normally extracting a representative part of a
 text.
 Such a process is a data transformation process and it happens for example
 when a text is reduced to a list of words according to their frequency.
 In this case the method chosen to represent the data belong to a family
 of methods that suit this data type.
 In this review we will go through all the most referenced strategies to
 represent texts or collections of texts, paying special attention to the
 strategies to represent textual data as it is, as a regular text, with
 all its complexities, irregularities and rich abstractions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of texts is a key field for text visualization.
 In the next subsection we give a brief commentary on this field and its
 relationship with this work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Text analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Text analysis, almost synonymous with text mining, (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "feldman2006text"

\end_inset

) is an interdisciplinary field that includes information retrieval, data
 mining, machine learning, statistics, linguistics and natural language
 processing.
 According to M.
 Hearst (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "hearst_m._what_2003"

\end_inset

) in text mining, the goal is to discover heretofore unknown information,
 something that no one yet knows and so could not have yet written down.
 Text mining is a subfield of data mining whose typical applications, among
 others, are to analyze or compare literary texts, analyze biological and
 genomics data sequences or, more recently, discover patterns in customers
 behavior or discover fraud in the use of credit cards.
 Hearst differentiates this case from the information extraction operations,
 like the extraction of people's names, addresses or job skills.
 This later task can be done with 80% of accuracy, but the first task, the
 full interpretation of natural language by a computer program, again following
 Hearst, looks like will not be possible for

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the classification of Keim (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "keim_visual_2008"

\end_inset

) texts can be analyzed on different levels of abstraction: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Statistical level (e.g.
 frequencies of words, average sentence length, number of tokens or types,
 etc.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Structural level (structural components of a document, such as header, footer,
 title, abstract, etc.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Syntactical level (principles and rules for constructing sentences) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Semantic level (linguistic meaning) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pragmatic level (meaning in context; consequence for actions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to study visualization tools for texts it is as important to follow
 the literature of visualization tools as well as the literature of text
 analysis.
 The two fields are importantly interrelated.
 On one hand, the output of the text analysis can limit the possibilities
 of the visual presentation and interaction of the text itself.

\color white
 On the other, there is strong empirical evidence that people learn better
 with text and visualizations than with text alone.

\begin_layout Subsection
Methods, tools and visualizations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the idea that data visualization is used in and builds from a
 wide range of points of view and fields of knowledge, we found it necessary
 to define three important concepts used to refer to the visualization artifacts
 and the produced representation of data.
 These are: methods, tools and tasks, and visualizations.
 Since there is no clear definition and use of these expressions we want
 to define how we are using them and how we define their relationships.
 This is turn will allow us to refer to the elements of visualizations with
 three conceptual views.
 These three concepts have a hierarchical relationship: from a non-contextualize
d raw technique for representing data, what we call a method, to problem
 solving techniques based on specific data, what we call tools and tasks.
 To, finally, a contextualized visual discourse, i.e a complete visualization.
 This definitions can help us to emphasize or deconstruct parts of the visualiza
tion cases we are presenting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concepts can be represented in what we call the visualization pyramid
 (see

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the smallest piece of data representation.
 Examples of visualization methods are: pie chart, bar chart, word cloud,
 Venn diagram, time line, etc.
 A method is a way to represent data and it does not include any context.
 A method is always integrated in a context.
 A context can have a dataset, an introductory text, a history, an interface,
 among other components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Tools and tasks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a dataset is injected in a method we get a tool that can perform one
 or more tasks in a particular context.
 A method can be used in different contexts and in different ways depending
 on the required tasks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visualization tool is the most used expression when referring to a data
 representation system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Visualization and contexts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, when one or more tools are used in a specific context, some properties
 need to be defined and adapted: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Graphic components: scales, sizes, and colors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Texts: introduction, header, and legends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Data: format and injection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A tool, under this point of view, can produce a lot of visualizations.

Classification of tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in the introduction (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Early-research-question:"

\end_inset

) this research focuses on visualization tools in which the data type is
 a 1-dimensional text, i.e., a natural text.
 If we follow typical text analysis that represents a text with a bag-of-words
 then we will quickly end up studying network representations and this is
 not the goal of this research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, as we also have mentioned, we are interested in text collection
 visualization and exploration tools, and this is a more common case of
 study with a variety of standard visualization methods, including network
 diagrams among others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ground level of classification of text visualization tools according
 to the type of data has two categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Textual documents: this is the representation of single texts.
 We can understand text as a sequence of words ordered according to the
 hierarchy: document > paragraphs > sentences > other punctuation marks

) > words > syllable and phonemes.
 In cases where the text is a book or other kind of structure, then, it
 is possible to have more granularities including: chapters > sections >
 sub sections > ...
 Also we assume the metadata of the text and other attached texts: title,
 authors, publishers, copyright notes, acknowledgement, dedication, preface,
 table of contents, forward, glossary, bibliography, index, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Text collections: groups of texts in which each item is a clearly differentiable
 entity.
 Usually when talking about collections of texts, we talk about texts that
 have some similarity, either in register, length, or structure.
 All the cases we have reviewed are collections of the same kind of texts.
 Heterogeneous collections of texts are also referenced in the literature
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "meeks_e._documents_2011"

\end_inset

), especially for a representative analysis of a field of knowledge, in
 which cases the goal of the collection is to include the maximum variety
 of expressions and a wide vocabulary.
 In these cases the dataset is heterogeneous according to its structure
 and register.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting from these two very differentiated kinds of visualizations, we
 have added several subjective subdivisions to each case according to the
 goals of this research.
 The aims of the classification is to support the description and explanation
 of the reviewed cases, as well as to suggest key features of text visualization
 tools.

\begin_layout Subsection
For single texts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Whole or part?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases a part of the text is considered the essence of the text and
 it is used for the visualization instead of the whole text.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, there are representations where the whole text participates.
 These cases often represent the whole text implicitly.
 Examples of this are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The chapters of a book but not all its text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The representation of all the sentences of the text as colored lines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The verbs of a text, providing an impression of the style of the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The characters of a novel and their appearance within the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The places or dates present in the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cases in which the whole text is explicitly represented, for obvious
 reasons, are cases with short texts, e.g texts of songs, speeches, poems,
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:1Novel-Views:-Les"

\end_inset

 only certain words within the text are represented; nonetheless we classify
 this case as a whole text representation because the whole novel, chapter
 by chapter, is implicitly represented along the circle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases in which the whole text is represented, even implicitly, as one
 main element of the visualization we have classified them as whole text
 visualization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Does the visualization follow the text sequence?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is the visualization following the same sequence as the original text does?
 By sequence we mean the same order as in the text.
 If yes, the case will be considered sequential, otherwise it will be called
 non-sequential.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a typical case that does not follow the sequence of the original
 text is a word cloud (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:From-1765-to"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Discourse structure or Syntactic structure?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among others, a text can have two kinds of structure that we consider useful
 for our research.
 There is a structure that is completely subjective to the author's point
 of view, this is the so-called discourse structure.
 In linguistics, discourse is a broad concept.
 Here we are using it to refer to the parts of a text and the outline of
 a document: parts, chapters, sections, subsections, etc.
 The discourse structure is widely used when visualizing texts because it
 is an easy way to draw a representation of the text sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second structure that we consider is the syntactic structure.
 Syntactic can also refer to several concepts, here we are using it to refer
 to: sentences, phrases, and words as verbs, nouns, and morphemes.
 This is an objective structure and depends on the rules of linguistics
 rather than an author's decision.
 In text visualization, elements of this structure, such as sentences, are
 very common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
For text collections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Are the items of the collection differentiated or represented as aggregations?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How is each item of the collection graphically represented? Is each text
 represented as a graphical entity, i.e., a point or a word or short sentence?
 Can the items in the visualization be counted, i.e., are they visually differenti
ated? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are cases in which each item is not represented by a graphically separated
 entity, but as a colored zone for example.
 Another case is when the items are accumulated and shown as frequency distribut

Just data or data and landscape?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is there any graphical context accompanying the items of the collection?
 Is there any other dataset, a part from the one coming from the text, also
 represented? Some cases present the items immersed in a graphical environment,
 like a map.
 This context can be a real geographical map, a metaphor, or, for example,
 a conceptual landscape composed by words forming a second layer that complement
s the collection data layer in which every distance plays a role: item-item
 (similarity between documents), word-item (importance of a word in a document),
 word-word (similarity between words in the collection).

Is time involved?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are the texts changing in time? There is a set of visualization tools that
 show the changes of a datasets over time.
 Most popular tools of this kind have been developed in computer science
 representing code evolution or in Wikipedia showing a number of aspects
 of article revisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also include in this category visualizations in which the dataset changes
 over time, for example in a visualization of the latest news, the dataset
 grows over time.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Is the visualization a result of a search query?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visualizations of the output of the information systems retrieval is
 well defined kind of visualization characterized by the changing number
 of represented items depending on the number of search results obtained.
 This is a growing visualization subfield related to the disciplines of
 information systems and information retrieval (

Number of cases: We found fifteen cases in the whole text visualization
 category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Years: The cases have been published from 1995 to 2013 (eighteen years).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Authors: All the authors come from academic fields.
 The most prolific authors in this category are Jeff Clark and Joel Deshaye
 with three cases each, followed by Martin Wattenberg, two cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
About the datasets: Most of the text corpora used belong to literature (eight
 cases).
 Most of authors use literature texts to demonstrate new visualization tools;
 especially well known texts, like classic novels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
About the methods: All the cases except one (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:14Arc-diagram-Wattenberg"

\end_inset

) use color as part of the visualization method.
 Five cases use methods that are bar chart derivatives (cases 4, 5, 6, 9
 and 11).
 Three cases use curves connecting parts of the texts: two arcs and one
 radial diagrams (cases 1, 8 and 14).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Discussion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not possible to establish a common method for whole text visualizations.
 As expected, all the cases present an axis that represents the whole text.
 In all the cases except in two, the text line is represented by a horizontal
 or a vertical line.
 The exceptions represent the text line as a circle (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:1Novel-Views:-Les-1"

\end_inset

) and as an iconification of a text in a page, (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:7Texty,-a-visualization"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since whole text visualization always includes an abstraction of the text
 that we call text line, a question arises: which part of the text is physically
 present in the reviewed whole text visualizations? It is surprising that
 most of the cases, nine out of fifteen, did not show a single word (cases:
 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15).
 Four cases show a small number of words (1, 2, 12, 13).
 Only two cases show all the text, cases 3 and 14.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common pattern is to show the occurrence of some feature - perhaps
 term, or topic, or cross-reference, or character - within the text as a
 whole (all the cases except 3, 12, 13 and 15).
 Except in Wattenberg's arc diagrams, occurrence is represented by same
 color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is interesting to observe how some cases represent very similar data in
 very different ways.
 This is the case of History Flow by Viégas and Wattenberg (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:10History-Flow-by"

\end_inset

) and Favoured Traces by Fry (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:6On-the-Origin"

\end_inset

): both show the same thing - document version history by document section
 - but the first is spatialized and the second animated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also see similarities between Texty (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:7Texty,-a-visualization"

\end_inset

), and TileBars (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:15TileBars:-Visualization-of"

\end_inset

).
 Here Texty uses the same technique as TileBars, highlighting some words
 of the text inside a rectangular figure that represents the whole text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also observe cases that are opposite or complementary one to another,
 like Wattenberg's Arc diagram (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:14Arc-diagram-Wattenberg"

\end_inset

), which shows repetition, and Hurst's novelty visualization (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:5Visualizing-Lexical-Novelty"

\end_inset

), which shows only new strings, not repetitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Literature and other complex texts, like political speeches (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:4State-of-the"

\end_inset

) or the bible (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:8Bible-Cross-References-by"

\end_inset

) dominate the kind of corpora of this category (ten cases).
 In our opinion, this is surprising because these texts are complex, sometimes
 with a high level of abstraction and little formal structure.
 In our opinion, in order to introduce or test a new tool, it is a good
 idea to work with more structured and 
\shape italic
easier
\shape default
 texts, with greater regularity in vocabulary, text length, discourse structure
 and language register.
 Literature, due to its inherent freedom of writing, does not need to follow
 any pattern or rule that can help us to structure the unstructured.
 Examples of more structured texts are scientific papers, patent texts,
 health diagnostics, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, depending on how the text is treated and processed, the nature
 of the text is not always a key point.
 For example, the work of Matthew Hurst (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:5Visualizing-Lexical-Novelty"

\end_inset

) tracks the introduction of new terms along a text.
 This tool can be used by literature experts and, at the same time, it can
 be applied to any other text with results not related to the complexity
 of the texts because of the ubiquity of the method.
 Yet it would be interesting to apply this method to scientific papers in
 which the style is a lot more defined.
 Similar ideas are applicable to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:1Novel-Views:-Les-1"

\end_inset

, and

Description:

\begin_layout Itemize
Number of cases: We found eight cases in the part text visualization category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Years: The cases have been published from 2005 to 2013 (eight years).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Authors and datasets: Two cases by Jeff Clark (cases 16 and 22) and one
 by the creative couple M.
 Wattenberg and F.B.
 Viégas in collaboration with F.
 van Ham (case 19) use literary texts.
 The two cases by Chris Harrison use large bi-gram datasets published by
 Google.
 There is one case not dependent on the nature of the text: Wordle (case
 17), the very popular word cloud method introduced by J.
 Feinberg.
 Finally two interactive tools that allow large datasets are presented:
 Docuburst (case 18) and Gist icons (case 23).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
About the methods: In six of the eight cases (cases 16, 17, 18, 19, 22 and
 23) the dataset is reduced to what is call a bag of words and only these
 words are present in the visualization.
 The cases 20 and 21 are representations of all bi-grams that two compared
 words share.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Discussion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part text visualization is a successful and popular way to visualize.
 This is probably because it is impressive that a long text can be effectively
 represented by a small set of words.
 Very simple statistical methods, like word frequency, can have an easy-to-under
stand result.
 A list of variously-sized-words is a direct way to communicate with any
 user, from beginner to expert.
 Most of the part text methods found online use statistical methods to extract
 the part from the whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that the extraction of part of the corpora can be affected by the
 structure of the text corpora and its complexity.
 In the reviewed visualizations, half of the cases present unstructured
 text corpora, but the criteria to extract the part from the whole is very
 well defined: lists of verbs (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:16Novel-Views:-Les"

\end_inset

), words that are found in the text in an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

X and Y
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-pattern (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:18Docuburst-by-C."

\end_inset

), and lists of words not included in a list of predefined empty words (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:21Word-Associations-Visualizing"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, cases with extraction based on word or phrase functionality instead
 of pure statistics would be more affected by the nature of the text.
 We have been focusing on these cases because they look more interesting
 according to the goals of the research.
 Thus, there is the case of Novel Views: Les Misérables - Characteristic
 Verbs (case 16), which represents only verbs, and the case of Docuburst
 (case 18) which uses the 
\shape italic
crowdsourced
\shape default
 lexical database Wordnet as a human-like backup.
 And again the cases of Phrase Net (case 19) and the two Google bi-gram
 cases (cases 20 and 21).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common behavior we have found in part text visualization is that once
 a part of the text is extracted all the cases except one (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:22Document-Arc-Diagrams"

\end_inset

) discard any reference to the original text sequence in the visualization.
 See the following point for a further development of this idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Other subcategories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Sequential visualization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found sixteen cases out of twenty-three in single text visualization
 in which the visualization keeps a similar sequence as the original text
 does.
 Seven of the sixteen visualize the sequence using a discourse structure,
 mainly chapters.
 The rest, nine cases use syntactic elements to represent the original sequence
 of the text, mainly words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is remarkable that only one case (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:22Document-Arc-Diagrams"

\end_inset

) belonging to part text visualization follows the original text sequence.
 And, at the same time, all the whole text visualization cases are also
 sequential.
 It seems that sequentiality is intrinsic to whole text visualization.
 Whole text visualizations do not literally represent every word of the
 text, but a graphical metaphor of the whole text: a text line.
 This text line can represent a discourse structure of the text or a syntactic
 one, in any case, graphically there is a line or an area that represents
 the length of the text.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sequentiality in visualization allows the reader to go back and forward
 between the visualization as in the text.
 In the case of a long text, a book (nine out of sixteen cases) the visualizatio
n can act as a map or a guide to the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Non sequential visualization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As non sequential visualization we have found five cases: three of them

 One is network-like (

\begin_layout Standard
All eight cases found that follow a discourse structure of the text in the
 visualization are sequential visualizations.
 There are no cases in which the discourse structure appears unordered regarding
 the text.
 This is not surprising because in the cases in which a text is divided
 in chapters and each chapter is represented as an entity, we have considered
 them as collection visualizations (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:4State-of-the"

\end_inset

).
 This is why all the cases in this section represent the parts of the text
 ordered and aligned in a line or a curve.
 Out the eight cases, five represent chapters or sections of a book, two
 represent volumes, and there is one special case (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:11Colour-coded-chronological-seq"

\end_inset

) in which the text is divided in colors according to purely narrative topics
 and scenes.
 This is the only case we could find that uses discourse structure elements
 deeper than chapter, sections, books and volumes.
 Probably any deeper method, such as, for example, narrative topics, would
 require manual text line segmentation.

The second half of the sequential cases, eight, use

intrinsic text elements

, like groups of words (four cases, cases 7, 18, 22 and 23), verbs (one
 case, 16), sentences (two cases, 4 and 9), and a complete text analysis
 (case 3).
 Syntactic structure requires parsing of the text word by word, sometimes
 using a database of lexical or semantic list of words, sometimes parsing
 sentences and paragraphs.
 Syntactic structure visualization is less dependent on the nature of the
 text in the sense that the methodology is agnostic to the complexity of
 the text.
 Usually software automatically extracts or marks the chosen syntactic elements.

The three cases under search results visualization were presented as web
 applications and therefore interactive.
 The user could query the visualization tool and get a unique representation
 for each search.
 The three cases we are presenting are no longer on line.
 Docuburst (case 18) is a Prefuse application that can be downloaded (

TileBars is a classic case (according to Google scholar, cited 625 times)
 by a classic author on visualization and interfaces of search engines,
 Marti Hearst.

).
 These three cases have in common that they are applied to large datasets
 and, starting with a search query, they show an improved search output
 with the aim of helping the user in the process of reading and filtering
 the results.
 In the three cases it seems a key task is to distinguish between similar
 items.
 TileBars searches PubMed, more than twenty million papers.
 Docuburst uses WordNet lexical database (155,287 words organized in 117,659
 synsets for a total of 206,941 word-sense pairs) to classify the visualized
 text.
 And Gist Icons examples represent, among other datasets: the complete set
 of approximately 7 million USPTO patents and Enron email data set comprised
 of 500,000 emails.

We present two cases in which the visualization tools can be used to understand
 or follow the evolution over time of the represented text.
 The dynamic text visualization demonstrates that data visualization can
 be almost the only way to solve some tasks and not only one more way of
 pure data advocation.
 For example it is really difficult to show how an entry from the Wikipedia
 evolves over time according to editors participation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:10History-Flow-by"

 History flow is a clear solution to solve this problem and it helps to
 understand part of the complex collaborative process that Wikipedia is.

The first English edition was approximately 150,000 words and the sixth

\begin_layout Itemize
Number of cases: We found sixteen cases in the items visualization category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Years: The cases have been published from 1996 to 2013 (seventeen years).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Authors: The most prolific authors in this category are Chris Harrison (cases
 13, 32, 33 and 34) and Jeff Clark (cases 24, 25 and 26), followed by Moritz
 Stefaner with two cases (cases 29 and 30).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disciplines and datasets: It is remarkable that nine cases are datasets
 from the Internet: Wikipedia (cases 29, 34 and 36), search engines (cases
 31, 37 and 38), twitter (case 26), on line media (case 32), web pages (case
 39) .
 In this category there are only three cases that use literary texts (cases
 24, 25 and 28).
 Finally two cases represent scientific papers (cases 27 and 33), one case
 represents media art datasets (case 30) and one represents non specific
 collections (case 35).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Discussion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The big difference between single text visualizations and collection visualizati
ons is the nature of the text.
 In collections most of the texts are not literature and are accessible
 on line.
 Probably the nature of the text is less important when the goal of the
 representation is the collection instead of the text itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Item visualizations use methods that are independent from the nature of
 the items.
 Once the collections of texts are itemized then the dataset can be considered
 a general case of data visualization and not 
\shape italic
pure
\shape default
 case of text visualization.
 This is why in this category, to generalize, the methods we find are well
 known and used in other visualization fields.
 Following this reasoning we find six network visualizations (cases 25,
 28, 34, 37, 38 and 39), three time lines (cases 31, 32 and 33), and three
 cases that use also time lines but allowing categorization-based grouping
 (cases 26, 30 and 35).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are four cases that, in our opinion, are really specific
 to text visualization.
 Two of them are dedicated to item comparison: 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:24Novel-Views:-Les"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:27Word-storm-by"

\end_inset

.
 Segment Word Clouds is noteworthy to say that it transforms a single text
 in a text collection.
 It represents the chapters of 
\shape italic
Les Misérables
\shape default
 as word cloud items.
 That makes it easy to compare them.
 It also uses color to spot words that are newly prominent in the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Word Storm is a reinvention of the word cloud, more concretely is a variation
 of Wordle (case 17) that makes word clouds comparable.
 This is done by assigning a fixed position to each word.
 This simple idea makes it visually easy to compare word clouds while maintainin
g the usual word cloud features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the most original cases that deserve to be mentioned specifically
 are Notabilia (case 29) and Chromograms (case 36).
 Notabilia is a very specific design that shows the evolution of the Wikipedia
 discussions called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Article for deletion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These discussions are sometimes close to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flame wars
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 due to the controversy over the simple existence of some articles.
 Notabilia represents the evolution and the final decision of the one hundred
 longest discussions.
 The visualization is done by Moritz Stefaner and is an interactive bushtree
 that highlights branches when moused over.
 The shape of the branches tells you about the nature of the discussion:
 cyclic, straight, or never-ending.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromograms is also a work based on Wikipedia data.
 It analyzes the comments of the editors for each edition of a Wikipedia
 entry.
 Visually it produces color coded stripes that in a short area easily tell
 you about years of editions of Wikipedia entries.

\begin_layout Standard
Aggregation visualization is the category with a clearly biggest variability
 of methods.
 The ten methods in this category, apart from representing collections,
 only have in common that they are not representing specific items.

 is a matrix (a table-like) visualization that allows row sorting by clicking
 columns.

 the sixty two Grimm's fairy tales.
 It is a powerful tool to understand, compare and go through all the stories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

\end_inset

 is a case that represents an intermediary dataset called topic models (

 Topic model is a more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

 is an specific interface that uses bar charts to show Wikipedia editions
 in real time.
 It is remarkable that the project used a device called Arduino (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 digital and material worlds.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is also an specific visualization method that shows most popular search

 is a surprising application at its time, 1996.
 It transformed a search engine results list in a multimedia (at the time
 text and images, basically) mash up using the metaphor of a book.
 This was a pure collection of texts (web pages) visualization that presented
 the results as aggregations of text and images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally we present 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 a great idea of visualization that has multiple uses.
 It is comparable to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The typical idea of landscape data is a network visualization with two layers
 of data, as is the case in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:28Topic-Networks-in"

\end_inset

.
 The first layer is the list of Marcel Proust texts represented as items,
 and the second layer is a network of topic models of the texts.
 The positions of the nodes of both layers are optimized.
 Proximity means more related nodes.
 This definition of landscape can be found also in the defunct cases of
 search engine results: 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of the cases classified under this category show collections of
 texts in combination with more data.
 This is the case in Dotplot which represents the coincidence or not of
 strings in various texts, and in Grimm's Fairy Tale Metrics that combines
 a list of texts in the rows with several parameters in the columns.
 These parameters are not directly part of the text, but recalculated features
 related to the text, like the length, the lexical diversity and the presence
 of different groups of words that represent entities (for example: body
 -> hand, head, heart, eyes and foot) in each tale.

 visualizations have a lot more cases with search capacities (three cases

The four cases we include in this category allow the user to follow the

 Only one is designed to be real-time (

One difficulty for a tool that represents collections of texts changing
 over time is the access to an updated feed or an accessible API.
 Probably for this reason three out of the four use Wikipedia data and the
 other one uses Google news.
 In all the cases these are on line sources that have long allowed public
 access to their feeds.

At the time that these conclusions are being written, the practice part
 of the research has already begun.
 The first goal is to develop ideas to visualize collections of papers from
 scientific conferences.
 It will involve collection visualization as well as single text visualization.
 The aim is to develop two to three views or representations of the conference
 to help provide researchers with rich information on the contents of the
 conference.
 The idea involves show what the conference is about as well as which topics
 are not present.
 This literature review is the starting point.

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the literature review we are sure that we have not covered all
 the existing ideas related to text visualization.
 Certainly because data and text visualization is a relatively new field
 there is no single consolidated list of dedicated publications and sources.
 This presents a challenge in making a comprehensive survey of work in the
 field.
 Some of the cases we are presenting have been found in very specific publicatio
ns; for example Joel Deshaye and Peter Stoicheff and their works on Faulkner's
 visualizations (cases 11, 12 and 13).
 Reading Stoicheff's notes it can be seen that they developed the tools
 just to assist in a very specific study of William Faulkner's narrative
 time lines.
 There are no references to applications of these interesting ideas to other
 texts, suggesting that more works remain hidden in the depths of other
 fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Text visualization, as we argue in this document, can be considered a subfield
 of data visualization.
 Yet, the boundaries of the field are sometimes not clearly defined.
 This is the case of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:31Search-Clock-by"

\end_inset

, in which the text corpora is an enormous dataset of search engine queries.
 Can this dataset be considered a collection of texts if each of them is,
 in most cases, is only one or two words long? Is there a minimum length
 of a text to be considered as a text? We decided to treat this case as
 a collection of texts, short ones, but, ultimately, texts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important decision in this review has been the classification of the
 cases found.
 Since there are few papers that review text visualization tools, we referenced
 the classic data visualization reviews 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shneiderman_eyes_1996"

\end_inset

 as well as new ones (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "collins2009docuburst"

\end_inset

).
 In these cases the classifications were based on tasks that the visualization
 tool can solve rather than on the explicit aspects of the visualization.
 This is why we decided to propose our own classification that, while far
 from perfect, is hopefully a useful approach to a classification based
 on visual features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the list of insights and gaps we have found so far:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Single text visualization cases are applied mainly to literature.
 Literature is an unstructured text; apart from complex combinations of
 words it can have high levels of human abstraction and freedom of structures
 and experimentation.
 It might be more effective to apply visualization techniques to other kinds
 of texts with a more formal register and/or predefined style, such as legal
 texts, scientific papers, template based texts and communications, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We have found only one single/part text visualization case which is sequential
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:22Document-Arc-Diagrams"

\end_inset

).
 Most part text visualizations extract the essence of the text based on
 some criteria and the original sequence of the text is lost.
 Since sequential visualization tools have some advantages, it seems there
 is room to develop part visualization tools that maintain the original
 text sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Collection visualizations use methods that can be found in data visualization
 in general.
 This idea invites experimentation in bringing more standard data visualization
 methods and tools to the specific text visualization subfield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Collections of aggregations is the category that has developed more specific
 designs and ideas.
 More work needs to be done in order to find some patterns in this kind
 of visualization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open questions related to nature of texts to be faced during this research
 include: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How can we extract the human part of a text?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In some ways, text to bag-of-words is a 
\shape italic
machinification
\shape default
 of the text, a simplification.
 What are we loosing in this transformations?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the intrinsic human part of a text matters? In which tasks can be important
 to extract it and show it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are really big questions that quickly go outside the scope of the
 project, as it is defined here.
 To talk about many of these things we would need to go in to textual analysis
 in literature, as well as computational linguistics, digital humanities
 among other fields.
 As these fields are related but not directly belonging to data visualization,
 we assume that this research project will require investigation in these
 fields in order to contextualize and understand the tasks and challenges
 in which data visualization can help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And finally: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Why is it that most of reviewed cases older than five years are no longer
 on line? If these tools are no longer (or never have been) in use, we should
 question their effectiveness.
 We have not investigated how many are part of commercial software products
 and how many, after being published, are just forgotten.
 In any case it is questionable why some great ideas did not become new
 standards.
 Should this research study or contribute to fighting this tendency? This
 project aims to produce applications that will be adopted in some field
 or to solve some task for some group of users; but as these cases show,
 adoption is a significant challenge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We hope to answer these and other questions in the long and challenging
 journey of this practical research project.

description: Case collected by Peter Stoicheff: "This graph (contributed
 by Joel Deshaye) represents time in three different dimensions.
 First, there is the sequence of four sections in the novel - the narrative
 time or récit (shown in green).
 Second, there is the chronology, l'histoire (shown in orange), beginning
 with the earliest recollected date in the novel - Damuddy's death in 1898.
 These two dimensions show how the conventional view of linear time can
 be disrupted by a fictional narrative.
 Third, there is a representation of the proportion of memories of and flashback
s to the past in each section (shown in blue).
 This last dimension shows how the novel progresses from an emphasis on
 the past toward an emphasis on the present."

TileBars, which provides a compact and informative iconic representation
 of the documents’ contents with respect to the query terms.
 The goal is to simultaneously indicate: the relative length of the document,
 the frequency of the term sets in the document, and the distribution of
 the term sets with respect to the document and to each other.
 Each large rectangle indicates a document, and each square within the document
 represents a TextTile.
 The darker the tile, the more frequent the term (white indicates 0, black
 indicates 8 or more instances)

description: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Using Google's enormous bigram dataset, I produced a series of visualizations
 that explore word associations.
 Each visualization pits two primary terms against each other.
 Then, the use frequency of words that follow these two terms are analyzed.
 For example, "war memorial" occurs 531,205 times, while "peace memorial"
 occurs only 25,699.
 A position for each word is generated by looking at the ratio of the two
 frequencies.
 If they are equal, the word is placed in the middle of the scale.
 However, if there is a imbalance in the uses, the word is drawn towards
 the more frequently related term.
 This process is repeated for thousands of other word combinations, creating
 a spectrum of word associations.
 Font size is based on a inverse power function (uniquely set for each visualiza
tion, so you can't compare across pieces).
 Vertical positioning is random.

words are bucketed into one of 25 different rays.
 Each of these represent a different tendency of use (ranging from 0 to
 100% in 4% intervals).
 Words are sorted by decreasing frequency within each ray.
 I render as many words as can fit onto the canvas.
 There is a nice visual analogy at play - the "lean" of each ray represents
 the strength of the tendency towards one of the two terms.
 As in the word spectrum visualization, font size is based on a inverse
 power function (uniquely set for each visualization, so you can't compare
 across pieces).
 Common words (a, the, for, as, etc.) are not shown.

X by Y visualizes all submissions to the Prix Ars Electronica, from the
 early beginnings in 1987 up to 2009.
 The goal is to characterize the "ars world" in quantitative terms.
 A series of diagrams groups and juxtaposes the submissions by years, categories
, prizes and countries.
 The graphics are composed of little dots (each representing a single submission
) to provide a visual scale for the statistical statements and thematize
 the relation of the totality and the individual.

 examination of trends that would otherwise be broken up.
 The data I had access to was both large and noisy.

using the Digg API, I grabbed the top 10 most-dugg stories of the day (by
 midnight) for the past year - May 24, 2007 to May 23, 2008.
 I then rendered a series of tree-ring-like visualizations (moving outwards
 in time).
 Rings are colored according to Digg's eight top-level categorizations (see
 key at bottom of page).
 Ring thickness is linearly proportional to the number of diggs the story
 received.
 I also made a pair of visualizations using Digg's entire archive, which
 goes back to December 1, 2004.

HotSauce worked as a plug-in to an existing browser so that when a hyperlink
 to a MCF-enabled website was selected the user was dropped into a first-person
 perspective view of the Web.
 It was a videogame view with Web pages floating as brightly colored blocks
 in an infinite black space, something like the view from a starship cockpit
 navigating through some strange asteroid field.
 It was easy to fly into and around the space, using the mouse to guide
 the direction of flight and holding down buttons to go forwards and backwards.
 A page could be accessed by simply double-clicking on the relevant block.
 A 3D immersive environment where I could move around an Antarcti.ca like
 space, moving things around, interacting with others in that space.
 And I should be able to do this wherever I am!

description: "As soon as I got my hands on the data, I quickly got to work
 on some straight forward visualizations.
 The first type compares two sets of trigrams, each starting with a different
 word.
 One visualization compares 'He' with 'She', while the other uses 'I' and
 'You'.
 In the case of the 'He' vs.
 'She', the top 120 trigrams for each were identified.
 The frequencies of the second word in the trigrams were combined and sorted,
 and rendered in decreasing frequency-of-use order.
 A similar process was used to create a ranking for the third (and final)
 word in the trigrams.
 Words are sized according to the square root of their use frequencies.
 The color-coded lines act like paths (a tree structure), enumerating all
 of the trigrams.
 The process was identical for the 'I' and 'You' version, except that only
 the top 75 trigrams were used."

\begin_layout Itemize
description: FeatureLens visualizes a text collection at several levels
 of granularity and enables users to explore interesting text patterns.
 The current implementation focuses on frequent itemsets of n-grams, as
 they capture the repetition of exact or similar expressions in the collection.
 Users can find meaningful co-occurrences of text patterns by visualizing
 them within and across documents in the collection.
 This also permits users to identify the temporal evolution of usage such
 as increasing, decreasing or sudden appearance of text patterns.
 The interface could be used to explore other text features as well.

 articles that exist inside each news cluster that the Google News Aggregator
 presents.
 In that way users can quickly identify which news stories have been given
 the most coverage, viewing the map by region, topic or time"
