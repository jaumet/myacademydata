                 and the tool they use to interact with them: the search
                 user interface. The truly worldwide reach of the Web
                 has brought with it a new realization among computer
                 scientists and laypeople of the enormous importance of
                 usability and user interface design. In the last ten
                 years, much has become understood about what works in
                 search interfaces from a usability perspective, and
                 what does not. Researchers and practitioners have
                 developed a wide range of innovative interface ideas,
                 but only the most broadly acceptable make their way
                 into major web search engines. This book summarizes
                 these developments, presenting the state of the art of
                 search interface design, both in academic research and
                 in deployment in commercial systems. Many books
                 describe the algorithms behind search engines and
                 information retrieval systems, but the unique focus of
                 this book is specifically on the user interface. It
                 will be welcomed by industry professionals who design
                 systems that use search interfaces as well as graduate
                 students and academic researchers who investigate

                 within the university, artists have been challenged to
                 review their practice in academic terms. This has
                 become a vigorous epicentre of debates concerning the
                 nature of research in the artistic disciplines. The
                 special issue {"On} Reflecting and Making in Artistic
                 Research Practice{"} captures some of this debate. This
                 editorial article presents a broad-brush outline of the
                 debates raging in the artistic disciplines and presents
                 three discernible trends in those debates. The trends
                 highlight different core questions: (1) Art as
                 research: Can artistic practice represent forms of
                 inquiry acceptable within academic settings? (2)
                 Academically-attuned practice-led research: Can art
                 practice and research practice cooperate as equal

  abstract =     "We report on results of a series of user studies on
                 the perception of four visual variables that are
                 commonly used in the literature to depict uncertainty.
                 To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first
                 formal evaluation of the use of these variables to
                 facilitate an easier reading of uncertainty in
                 visualizations that rely on line graphical primitives.
                 In addition to blur, dashing and grayscale, we
                 investigate the use of 'sketchiness' as a visual
                 variable because it conveys visual impreciseness that
                 may be associated with data quality. Inspired by work
                 in non-photorealistic rendering and by the features of
                 hand-drawn lines, we generate line trajectories that
                 resemble hand-drawn strokes of various levels of
                 proficiency-ranging from child to adult strokes-where
                 the amount of perturbations in the line corresponds to
                 the level of uncertainty in the data. Our results show
                 that sketchiness is a viable alternative for the
                 visualization of uncertainty in lines and is as
                 intuitive as blur; although people subjectively prefer
                 dashing style over blur, grayscale and sketchiness. We
                 discuss advantages and limitations of each technique
                 and conclude with design considerations on how to
                 deploy these visual variables to effectively depict
                 various levels of uncertainty for line marks.",

                 Written from a computer science perspective by three

                 predict {3D} positions of body joints from a single
                 depth image, using no temporal information. We take an
                 object recognition approach, designing an intermediate
                 body parts representation that maps the difficult pose
                 estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel
                 classification problem. Our large and highly varied
                 training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body
                 parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc.
                 Finally we generate confidence-scored {3D} proposals of
                 several body joints by reprojecting the classification
                 result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200
                 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation
                 shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test
                 sets, and investigates the effect of several training
                 parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our
                 comparison with related work and demonstrate improved
                 generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest

                 behavior has always been to find out what other people
                 think. With the growing availability and popularity of
                 opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and
                 personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise
                 as people now can, and do, actively use information
                 technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of
                 others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of
                 opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with
                 the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and
                 subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in
                 part as a direct response to the surge of interest in
                 new systems that deal directly with opinions as a
                 first-class object. This survey covers techniques and
                 approaches that promise to directly enable
                 opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus
                 is on methods that seek to address the new challenges
                 raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to
                 those that are already present in more traditional
                 fact-based analysis. We include material on
                 summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues
                 regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact
                 that the development of opinion-oriented

  abstract =     "The dramatic growth in practical applications for
                 machine learning over the last ten years has been
                 accompanied by many important developments in the
                 underlying algorithms and techniques. For example,
                 Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to
                 become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged
                 as a general framework for describing and applying
                 probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability
                 of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the
                 development of a range of approximate inference
                 algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation
                 propagation, while new models based on kernels have had
                 a significant impact on both algorithms and
                 applications. This completely new textbook reflects
                 these recent developments while providing a
                 comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern
                 recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at
                 advanced undergraduates or first-year {PhD} students,
                 as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous
                 knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning
                 concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate
                 calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some
                 experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful
                 though not essential as the book includes a
                 self-contained introduction to basic probability
                 theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine
                 learning, statistics, computer science, signal
                 processing, computer vision, data mining, and
                 bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for
                 course instructors, including more than 400 exercises,
                 graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a
                 subset of the exercises are available from the book web
                 site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained
                 by instructors from the publisher. The book is
                 supported by a great deal of additional material, and
                 the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for
                 the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume
                 will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition
                 and machine learning, and will include free software
                 implementations of the key algorithms along with
                 example data sets and demonstration programs.

                 System, a scalable distributed file system for large
                 distributed data-intensive applications. It provides
                 fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity
                 hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to
                 a large number of clients. While sharing many of the
                 same goals as previous distributed file systems, our
                 design has been driven by observations of our
                 application workloads and technological environment,
                 both current and anticipated, that reflect a marked
                 departure from some earlier file system assumptions.
                 This has led us to reexamine traditional choices and
                 explore radically different design points. The file
                 system has successfully met our storage needs. It is
                 widely deployed within Google as the storage platform
                 for the generation and processing of data used by our
                 service as well as research and development efforts
                 that require large data sets. The largest cluster to
                 date provides hundreds of terabytes of storage across
                 thousands of disks on over a thousand machines, and it
                 is concurrently accessed by hundreds of clients. In
                 this paper, we present file system interface extensions
                 designed to support distributed applications, discuss
