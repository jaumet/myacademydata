3. Research methodology, methods or process: What will you do? How will you do it?

[3Q1] What will you do?
[3Q2] How will you do it?

[3W1] to indicate the theories and principles underlying the approaches to be adopted in the research.
[3W2] to outline the methods which will be used for achieving the research objectives.
[3W3] to highlight any ethical issues or dimensions raised by the research methods or process.
[4W4] to indicate the sources of data to be used and how these will be collected and analysed.

[3C1] There must be a coherent link between the methods proposed for the study and the research objectives and questions.
[3C2] If your research involves human or animals, you need to indicate that you are aware of this and will seek approval of a UC Ethics Committee. See http://www.canberra.edu.au/ucresearch/ethics.

My outline:
3.1- Practice-based methodologies
3.2- Software engineering methodologies
3.3- Artisan software development methodologies: definitions, examples. 
     Main differences with commercial development way
     
	- Relationship developer-project-client.
	- Win-win scenario. List the interests from the developer in bringing the project to a happy end.
	- No money involved: pure research
	- Teams size (dev and client). Big fish wants to work with big fish
3.4- Development process (diagram + ) 

3.5- Evaluation
	- Define what needs to be evaluated
	- Tests during development (5 users) to find mistakes and unclear points
		* Online survey ater using the tool
	- Define the methods used:
		* Interviews + qualitative analysis
		* Thinking alloud + quaLitative analysis + critical view
		* User actions recording + quaNTitative analysis

JUSTIFY WHY THIS IS THE BEST METHODOLOGY!! COMPARED TO OTHERS, PROS AND CONS.
-> READ: Bill Mogridge “Designing Interactions” IDEO
-> EXAMPLES OF SUCCESFUL METHODS IN DATA VIS WORLD: stefaner, stamen, bestiario etc etc similar method as the one I propose here(!?)
-> Mark Bernstein: NeoVictorian Computing http://www.markbernstein.org/NeoVictorian.html
-> In corporative, SAP or ORACLE put people working in the customer company for a while.....
-> AGILE for example is not espontaneous.
