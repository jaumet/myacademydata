What is the purpose of the research?

[3W1] to present the main objectives of the research
[3W2] to present the more specific questions which will drive the research

[3C1] Having just identified the gaps in existing literature, you have now created the justification for doing your research. 
[3C2] This section could also come before the literature review â€“ in this case you use the literature review to support the need for your study.
[3C3] The research objectives might be presented in a number of different ways depending on the nature of the research. For example, in experimental research, the objectives might be framed as a hypothesis to be tested and confirmed; whereas in qualitative research the objectives are more likely a set of questions.
[3C4] You also need to position these objectives within a broader context
[3C5] No matter what form this section takes, there should be a coherent link between the problems identified through the critical review of literature and the objectives outlined here for your own research project.

Besides the development of tools and interfaces to work visually with data, this project aims also include:
- Engage/encourage groups of people to work with text visualisation tools in real scenarios introducing specially designed tools.
- Validate a methodology for the succesful implementation of text visualization and/or exploration applications  in real case scenarios.
- Contribute to identify the cases in which data visualization can be easily adopted/implemented.
